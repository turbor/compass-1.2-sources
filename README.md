## A newer version of Compass

Based on the released sources the well-known MSX user and developer Konamiman created a fork containing a lot of fixes to improve the user experience for modern MSX developers.

To avoid confusion and indicate that it was an improvement upon release 1.2.09, we agreed that he started numbering from 1.3 onwards.
And for an encore: the name was changed from "**Comp**joetania's **Ass**embler" to "**Kon**amiman's **P**henomenal **Ass**embler", whose moniker sounds almost like the original.

This fork is also hosted at [Github](https://github.com/Konamiman/Konpass/releases).
